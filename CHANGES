1.2 - Added indels and N's counting. Added more detailed statistics on misassemblies
      (classification in inversions, relocations, translocations, local misassemblies).
      Added more detailed statistics on partially unaligned contigs. Text reports now 
      available in LaTeX format also. Support for python 2.5 added. Fixed bug in reading
      genes annotations in GFF and NCBI formats. QUAST now can be rerun on existing
      Nucmer alignments files.

1.1 - Added mismatches counting. Fixed a bug in misassemblies counting
      (some inversions were omitted). GC content plot became logarithmically scaled.
      ORFs are not counted, GeneMark added instead (for gene finding).
      Nucmer aligner setting changed (from IDY% = 80 to 95, 
      i.e. now all alignments are more robust).

1.0 - Initial open source release!
