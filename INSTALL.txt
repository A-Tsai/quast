QUAST INSTALLATION README

1. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

QUAST can be run on Linux or Mac OS.

2. SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

For the main pipeline:
- python 2 (2.5 or higher)
- perl 5.6.0 or higher
- basic UNIX tools (g++, make, sh, csh, sed, awk, ar)

For the optional submodules:
- Time::HiRes perl module for GeneMark-ES (if using with `--gene-finding`)
- Boost (tested with v1.56.0) for Manta (if using with reads) and E-MEM (for a higher contig alignment performance)
- cmake (tested with v2.8.12) for Manta
- Java JDK (tested with OpenJDK 6) for GAGE

All those tools are usually preinstalled on Linux.
Mac OS, however, requires to install the Command Line Tools for Xcode to make them available.

QUAST draws plots in two formats: HTML and PDF. If you need the PDF versions,
you will also need to make sure that you installed Matplotlib.
We recommend to use Matplotlib version 1.1 or higher. QUAST is tested with Matplotlib v.1.3.1.
Installation on Ubuntu:
    sudo apt-get install -y pkg-config libfreetype6-dev libpng-dev python-matplotlib

    tar -xzf quast-4.2.tar.gz
    cd quast-4.2

Basic installation (36MB):
    ./setup.py install

Full installation (815MB, includes tools for SV detection based on read pairs
                   which is used for more precise misassembly detection;
                   and tools/data for reference genome detection in metagenomes):
    ./setup.py install_full
